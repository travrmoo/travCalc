# travCalc

I followed the Code With Cal tutorial @ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2gGNTKo_q8 to build this app. I used this as a learning experience
on how to work with storyboards. I learned how to manipulate stacks and how to use autolayout constraints for proper formatting.

I decided to not use this tutorials validation method, and have devised my own that removes invalid characters from the results string before 
computing the actual math. This is still a work in progress, but we are making progress.


I have written the code in such a way that the user could input something along the lines of "9+++*9" and the output would be "9*9" as "*" was the last
valid operator used.


I still need to fix instances where a user could input 
multiple decimals into a number.
